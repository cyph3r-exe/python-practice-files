"""Write a program that has a user defined function 
to accept the coefficients of a quadratic equation 
in variables and calculates its determinant. For 
example : if the coefficients are stored in the 
variables a,b,c then calculate determinant as 
b2-4ac. Write the appropriate condition to check 
determinants on positive, zero and negative and 
output appropriate result."""
